    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <p>My name is Joshua Oneshioagbe, and I hold a strong belief that life is fleeting, which is why we must make the most of every moment we have. A year ago, I graduated from the University of Benin, Nigeria, with a degree in Computer Engineering. Since then, I have been on a journey to find stability and direction in my career. This journey prompted me to ask myself a pivotal question: “What do you truly want to do?” That moment of introspection set me on the path to pursuing my passion.

        I am a creative brand and UI/UX designer with a deep love for technology and its transformative impact on our daily lives. The way innovation continuously improves the quality of human experiences fascinates me, and I am grateful to be alive at such an exciting time in history.
        
        As I explored various career paths, cloud engineering emerged as the answer to my quest for a fulfilling and impactful profession. Currently, while completing my NYSC (National Youth Service Corps), I am building a strong foundation in network engineering. I see cloud engineering as the natural next step—a complementary field that will equip me with the expertise to secure an entry-level role and contribute meaningfully to the tech ecosystem.
        
        Every challenge I have encountered has been a stepping stone toward growth, and I am committed to continuous learning, innovation, and creating solutions that make a difference.</p>
    
        <h1>Why I joined the AltSchool Africa Program</h1>
        <p>I joined the AltSchool Africa program because it is a school without walls, allowing me to advance my studies without returning to the rigid structure of a traditional university. I was particularly drawn to the Cloud Engineering track in the School of Engineering, as its robust and beginner-friendly curriculum provides the ideal foundation to kick-start my journey in cloud computing.</p>
