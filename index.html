    <h1>MY BASIC INFORMATION</h1>

    <h1>Name:</b>Joshua Oneshioagbe</h1>

    <h1><b>ALT School ID:</b>ALT/SOE/025/1133</h1>

    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <p>My name is Joshua Oneshioagbe, and I hold a strong belief that life is fleeting, which is why we must make the most of every moment we have. A year ago, I graduated from the University of Benin, Nigeria, with a degree in Computer Engineering. Since then, I have been on a journey to find stability and direction in my career. This journey prompted me to ask myself a pivotal question: “What do you truly want to do?” That moment of introspection set me on the path to pursuing my passion.

        I am a creative brand and UI/UX designer with a deep love for technology and its transformative impact on our daily lives. The way innovation continuously improves the quality of human experiences fascinates me, and I am grateful to be alive at such an exciting time in history.
        
        As I explored various career paths, cloud engineering emerged as the answer to my quest for a fulfilling and impactful profession. Currently, while completing my NYSC (National Youth Service Corps), I am building a strong foundation in network engineering. I see cloud engineering as the natural next step—a complementary field that will equip me with the expertise to secure an entry-level role and contribute meaningfully to the tech ecosystem.
        
        Every challenge I have encountered has been a stepping stone toward growth, and I am committed to continuous learning, innovation, and creating solutions that make a difference.</p>
    
        <h1>Why I joined the AltSchool Africa Program</h1>
        <p>I joined the AltSchool Africa program, firstly, because it is a school without walls. For me, that meant I didn’t have to return to the traditional classroom setting of a university to advance my studies. Instead, I could learn flexibly and gain practical, hands-on experience in a structured yet adaptable environment.

            Additionally, I chose AltSchool Africa because of its Cloud Engineering track within the School of Engineering. I believe this program provides a robust, beginner-friendly curriculum designed to help aspiring engineers build strong foundational skills while exposing them to real-world applications.
            
            Beyond the curriculum, I was drawn to AltSchool Africa because of its strong community and mentorship culture. Learning alongside like-minded individuals, receiving guidance from industry experts, and engaging in collaborative projects are invaluable aspects of my growth journey.
            
            Furthermore, the emphasis on career readiness and job placement support reassures me that I am not just acquiring knowledge but also preparing myself for real-world opportunities in Cloud Engineering.
            
            Most importantly, I see AltSchool Africa as more than just an educational platform—it is a launchpad for my career in tech, equipping me with the tools and confidence to transition into the industry and secure an entry-level role in Cloud Engineering.</p>
